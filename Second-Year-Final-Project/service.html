	  <p id='titles'>
	  As a part of Eco-Boosters, we want to improve the air quality and make sure that we make an effort towards reducing CO2 emissions. For this reason, we decided to create a service where you can rent a bike for a monthly fee in order to help reduce CO2 emissions.

	  Why use a bike instead of a car?
	  </h>
	  
	  <p>
		  Using a bike instead of a car brings many benefits. First off, in any economy, especially with the fluctuating gas prices, paying for gas is not something that most people love. It can get expensive fairly quickly, so riding a bike even once a week can save quite a bit of money over time. Secondly, cars put out a lot of exhaust, which pollutes the air, and riding your bike uses nothing but your own muscle power. Also, it requires much less energy to produce a bike than it does to manufacture a car. Third, you improve your physical health while riding to wherever your destination is.
